<p style="text-align: center"> # SOME CLEVER TITLE</p>

  I began the first copy of this rought draft in the from seat of a car I hope I can afford the payments on. Putting the pen to paper, I think about my sore feet and the 10,843 steps I've taken in the last 6.5 hours. The morning snow turned to rain before I could finish sheltering the for-sale plants from the elements, leaving those leg hands cold and wet as well. I like snow, and wish it managed to stay solid a little longer.
  
  I don't harbor resentments for the situation in which I presently find myself. No one is out to get me. I only hope to change what I can, and that is why I'm writing this. This is going to be the first entry in the public diary of my effort to better myself, learn new skills, and improve my life.
  
  More than a decade of being my own worst enemy has left me with a strange optimism. If I can be half as competent as an ally to myself, I feel like there is no telling what I can achieve.
  
  The skill I am focusing on is the creation of computer code, the DNA holding together the leaking life boat of 21st century post industrial life. Before I formally begin the journey and discuss specifics of this endeavor, I feel a compulsion to explain what programming has come to mean to me since I embarked 20 days (at the time of first writing, longer now) ago.
  
  As my astute readers will have no doubt deduced, I am not living my best life right now. I haven't for a very long time. In fact, I've only recently been blesse with the capacity to imaging what a best life might even look like.
  
  I'm not exactly sure what about programming attracted me in the first place. I've dabbled in it before, but never persisted beyond trivialities. One person's trivia is another's struggle, but this time I have succeeded in taking it much, much farther than ever before. And the reason I have persevered is clear to me: I found a concrete method of, even if only temporarily, banishing the ennui which has haunted me since my age took on a second digit.

  The second time I dabbled in learning code I was working through an online edition of Elegant JavaScript. One of the exercises was to write a program to calculate x^y, without using pow(). My solution presented plenty of constraints: y had to be a positive integer, x had to be positive. I think. Honestly it was so long ago the specifics of my final algorithm have been shrouded by memory. But there is one thing about that experience I remember as if it had just happened. I set out attempting to come up with a solution, recklessly scribbling pen on paper. I puzzled out the precise steps necessary to calculate the (positive integer) power of another number. Once I had accomplished that, I began a new struggle: to express those findings in JavaScript. I had a revelation that day, for the struggle was not in vain. before long I had a primitive HTML page with forms for the user to enter their own x and y, and be shown the result. 
  
  It felt _very_ good. What was this strange feeling? Contentment? I was proud of myself? This was a sensation I rarely had the opportunity to savor. If I had become aware then of what I know now, I might have spared myself from a great deal of pain. But at least that experience showed me one important thing. Solving problems felt good. It was a precious resource in a life dominated by doubt, a spring of pleasure, something I struggled to find elsewhere.
  
  And yet, back then, I lacked the wisdom to double down on this newfound source of good feeling. Instead I continued to seek pleasures elsewhere, often in places I shouldn't have. This lead me to dead end after dead end, and regrets that long outlived whatever pleasure I was able to conjure.
